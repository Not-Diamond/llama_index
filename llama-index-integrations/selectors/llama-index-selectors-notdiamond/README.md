# LlamaIndex Selectors Integration: NotDiamond

[Not Diamond](https://notdiamond.ai) offers an AI-powered model router that automatically determines which LLM is best-suited to respond to any query, improving LLM output quality by combining multiple LLMs into a **meta-model** that learns when to call each LLM.

Not Diamond supports cost and latency tradeoffs, customized router training, and real-time router personalization. Learn more via [the documentation](https://notdiamond.readme.io/).
